## Overview

<a href="#">Sourcetree for macOS</a> offers a graphical interface for working with Git repositories without relying solely on the command line. The visual commit history helps developers see branch structure, merge paths and changes over time. With staging tools, diff viewers and conflict resolution panels, the application supports both simple and advanced version control work. Bookmarks and repository groups help teams manage many codebases effectively.

For branching and merging, Sourcetree exposes Git’s capabilities clearly, making it easier to experiment without fear of losing track. Users can explore commit details, inspect file diffs and track remote changes. Integration with <a href="#">platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket</a> streamlines pushing, pulling and reviewing work. Advanced options like interactive rebase are available for users who need finer control, but the main interface remains approachable for everyday use.

On macOS, Sourcetree leverages native UI elements and behaves comfortably across single or multi-repository workflows. Over time, it becomes the visual anchor for many development pipelines—clarifying relationships between branches and supporting collaborative coding practices.
